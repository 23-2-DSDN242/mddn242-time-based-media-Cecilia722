## MDDN 242 Project 1: Dinner Leftover Clock

### Cecilia Hu

Update this file as you go along to record your progress.

My clock was inspired by the leftovers of a dinner. Whenever we start to eat, there will be less and less food on our plate as time goes on. But when we are full, the leftovers on the plate will not be reduced any more. Therefore, leftovers can also be symbolized as "stagnant time." At the same time, leftovers are also eternal, it will not be reduced again like dinner. These two common characteristics of leftovers and time prompted me to choose to complete my project in this way.
